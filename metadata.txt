name=Space Time Cube
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=This plugin creates a space-time cube based on given data.
version=1.1
author=Murat Çalışkan, Berk Anbaroğlu
email=caliskan.murat.20@gmail.com, banbar@hacettepe.edu.tr

about=The main purpose of the plugin is the detection of hot spots (space-time clusters) localised in space and time using two different statistics: Getis-Ord and Local Moran's I. 
    The plugin is composed of four tabs, in which the first one obtains the inputs -a space-time point dataset and the dimensions of the cube. The second and third tabs allows interactive analysis. "Temporal Change" tab allows temporal analysis on a selected cell. "Neighbours" tab allows investigation of the neighbouring cells of a selected cell. Finally, "Simulation" tab allows generation of random space-time point dataset for further analysis. 
    The four outputs of the plugin are as follows: 
    1. A csv file detailing the chosen statistics values at the cell level. 
    2. A csv file that providing information for individual points. 
    3. A shape file that visualises the created cells. 
    4. The tiff files for each time slice demonstrating the cell's statistics to allow raster analysis.
